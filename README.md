# Video Game Data
Download the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ashaheedq/video-games-sales-2019)

## Intro
The data I downloaded was a CSV of video game sales from 1988 all the way until 2019 and a bit of 2020. However, some of the 2019 and 2020 data is incomplete as those figures have not finished being published yet. The data includes total sales, where the sales were made, ratings of games, genres of games, and their titles respectively.

I love python, therefore I did most of my work through pandas and jupyter notebook, then exported my data, and made charts with the seaborn package in python, or in google sheets.
